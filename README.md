# Subterranean Substratum
Library for Subterranean xyz mods, which I have not yet worked on much. I've basically taken some core features from the stagnant subterranean-awakening in an attempt to make things a little bit more modular.

## Features
* Armor sets system - armor set can tick or provide attributes
* i-frames patches - damage sources are now treated individually
* Magic and void damage as attributes for use by entities or equipment
* Couple primitive status effects for use by entities or equipment
* Things I'll remember tomorrow about
